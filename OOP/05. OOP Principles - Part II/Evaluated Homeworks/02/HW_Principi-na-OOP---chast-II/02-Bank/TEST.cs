//02. A bank holds different types of accounts for its customers: deposit accounts, 
//    loan accounts and mortgage accounts. Customers could be individuals or companies.
//    All accounts have customer, balance and interest rate (monthly based). 
//    Deposit accounts are allowed to deposit and with draw money. Loan and mortgage accounts can only deposit money.
//    All accounts can calculate their interest amount for a given period (in months). 
//    In the common case its is calculated as follows: number_of_months * interest_rate.
//    Loan accounts have no interest for the first 3 months if are held by individuals 
//    and for the first 2 months if are held by a company.
//    Deposit accounts have no interest if their balance is positive and less than 1000.
//    Mortgage accounts have ½ interest for the first 12 months for companies and no 
//    interest for the first 6 months for individuals.
//    Your task is to write a program to model the bank system by classes and interfaces. You should 
//    identify the classes, interfaces, base classes and abstract actions and implement the calculation 
//    of the interest functionality through overridden methods.
